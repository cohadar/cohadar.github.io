Here is a list of programming languages that don't suck.
Java, Python, Go, C99, Lua

Of course *don't suck* is just my personal binary function here.
Don't suck is consisted of two properties: easy to learn, popular, no vendor lock-in.

## Easy to learn
This might seems like unimportant for a programming language, if language is complicated to learn but powerful is it not worth using? And my answer is NO. If you have 2 languages in the same niche and one is more easy to learn than the other one and does the same job, pick the easier one. World is full of languages too complicated to be useful, and frankly if language designer is not smart enough to make language both powerful and simple I don't care for it.
Every fool can make things more complicated, it takes a genius to express complex things elegantly.

## Popular
Again this might seem unimportant to some people, but after you get a bit older you realize that "Programming Language" translates into "Syntax for communicating with other programmers". Most of programming is reading code, not writing code. If you have 2 languages in the same niche and one is more popular, pick the popular one because you will be able to communicate with more people. There is value in unpopular languages like Lisp and Haskell and Erlang because you can learn new programming concepts by learning them, they are great for recreation programming, they are even useful in some industrial niches. But ultimately they are languages you can optionally learn _after_ you become an expert in some mainstream day-job language.

## No vendor lock-in
I will not lie, this is purely personal preference. People can have long and successful careers by specializing in vendor languages like C#, PL/SQL and Objective-C, in fact I have personally made money with VB6, C# and PL/SQL, but after witnessing vendor corporate policies first hand I have decided to walk the other path.
Some clarification is needed here, because for example Java is owned by Oracle and C# by Microsoft, but I don't consider Java a vendor language (neither does most people) because firstly Java actually has proper cross platform support and secondly you can program Java and have absolutely no connection with Oracle, while if you do C# you are one way or the other tied with Microsoft software and if you do Objective-C you are tied to Apple hardware. In the same vein I don't consider Go a vendor language because it is a proper cross-platform language without dependencies on Google technology stack.

### Java
A lot of people think Java sucks, but this is not true, it is mediocre Java programmers creating bloatware that suck, and it is company preferences for enterprise solutions that suck. Under above mentioned definition Java definitely does not suck, it is easy to learn, it is popular and it is vendor free. Oracle might own JDK but so many big companies have invested so much money in Java technologies that any attempt by Oracle to do some bullshit would result in a shitstorm. At the end of the day, this is the language that pays lots of developer salaries, respect it.

### Python
Ah the universal script glue. The biggest achievement of Python is that it has saved a ton of people from having to learn Perl
