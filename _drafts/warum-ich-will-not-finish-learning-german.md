The internet is full of cheap articles with titles like "Why You Never Finish Anything" or "The X Reasons Why You Procrastinate" written by people with no background in psychology or sociology whose only credentials are "I have been writting on various shit since two years ago".

These nobodies than procede to explain to you that you are lazy, afraid of success and generally a flawed human and that you can change yourself if you just follow their advice. Generic internet advice has the same value as Daily Zodiac Horoscope advice.

So why is this article any better? Because I am somehow expert in the subject? Yes because I will write about why I never finish stuff, and I am old enough to be expert on myself. As for advice you will have to extrapolate and make some for yourself.

It took me nine years to get my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering. I could say that this was because I was constantly eployed during school, but that would be just a lame excuse, it took me nine years because I was a lazy bastard and I wasted my time on useless crap.
What is important thou is that I did finish it because I decided to finish it.
When I had four exams left + bachelor thesis, I quit my job, finished everything in 8 months, took my diploma, and put it in the attic never to be seen again. I also firmly decided, despite peer and family pressure that I will never pursue a masters degree. A lot of life wisdom is knowing when to say NO.
