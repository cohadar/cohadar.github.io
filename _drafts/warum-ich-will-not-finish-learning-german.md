## .. or why I never finish (almost) anything

The internet is full of cheap articles with titles like "The X Reasons Why You Never Finish Anything" written by people with no background in psychology or sociology whose only credentials are "I have been writing on various shit since two years ago".

These nobodies than proceed to explain to you that you are lazy, afraid of success and generally a flawed human and that you can change yourself if you just follow their advice. Generic internet advice has the same value as Daily Zodiac Horoscope advice.

So why is this article any better? Because I am somehow expert in the subject? Yes, because I will write about why I never finish stuff, and I am old enough to be expert on myself. 

From time to time I would usually get a "brilliant idea" about "what I want to do in life" and then spend next 2-6 months investing time and energy in it and inevitably after some time it would all simply stop. All enthusiasm for the idea would disappear, and there will be a short period of relaxation until I find the next "big one".

Here is a sample of my most recent preoccupations:
	* I will learn German - (lasted for 6 months)
	* I will become Erlang expert - (lasted for 6 months)
	* I will make and sell my game - (recurring theme in my life, usually 6 months long)
	* I will become a Baduk master - (current level: 6k, after one year of playing)
	* I will start blogging - (this one was easy because "starting" stuff is my problem :)

I am currently obsessed with increasing my math skills in linear algebra, statistics and logic, and the reason I am doing it is because I "felt" like I have neglected math for a long time, which is to say I have no good reason at all, because I don't need advanced levels of math in my daily job. Oh and did I mention I started writing an SF novel.

So why do I do all this? Why don't I just pick one thing and stick to it? 
Well we first need to realize what all this things are: hobby's.
And the definition of hobby is "something you do along the way to chase away boredom".
People that keep one hobby for their entire life are extremely dull. What kind of mind collects old coins for 50 years (I did it for total of 5 months).
Some of our hobby's have a chance to become something bigger in our lives if we give them enough time. But in order to give significant amounts of time and energy to something you need a good reason, an emotional investment.
And this finally answers the question what all this starting and stopping of interests in our lives is all about.
It is a *search* on the three of life for things worth doing. Dull people stop after a couple of nodes. Focused but non-creative people do a depth first search. Easily distracted do a breadth first search. Smart people do [A*][astar].
