Life Choices
or how Mighty Cohadar became a programmer

I entered programming fairly late by today's kids standard.
It was in a first year of middleschool when I first saw a computer, I was 15.

The year was 1998 and the first computer I saw was a PC with Windows 98!
This was extreme cuttin edge of technology for a middle school in Serbia.

I distinctly remember that encounter in every detail, but not for reasons you might expect.
First task on a first day on "basics of programming" was to create a text file on desktop, enter some text, create an empty folder, than move a text file inside a folder.

I was the only kid in the whole class who could not do this!
The teacher explained every step to me over and over and gave up after 10 minutes, he had to move on with a cirriculum. Teacher and other students went on other tasks and I spent next 30 minutes stearing at win98 desktop like a total idiot. I think I never felt stupider in my whole life.

To understant just how stupid I felt here is some background.
The school was [Mathematical gymnasium][mg] the most elite school in Serbia.
On the entrance exam results, my name was the one directly below the red line, I did not pass!
The only reason I got into school was because someone above me has given up and there was one empty slot.

And on my first week of school on a first programming course I got a direct verification that I was officially the stupidest person in whole school. These kind of events make pretty deep memories.

On the next class I did not even listen to the teacher, don't even remember what class it was or who was a teacher, I only remember I spent the next class pondering how stupid I was and thinking how to tell my parents that I do not want to go to school any more.

But at some point, I do not know how a question popped in my head:
Am I really the stupidest person in school?
There were some contra-arguments, I remembered I started reading comics when I was 4 years old, 
and throuought the whole elementary school I was consistently considered smarter that EVERYBODY.
I knew I was smart, but Mathematical gymnasium was best of the best, am I now really the stupidest one?

First question led to the next one, I asked one of my classmates (the one I percieved to be doing best in computer exercises) how did he know so much about computers. The answer was unexpected: My parents tought me!
My next question was: but how can they teach you, are they programming teachers? No, he said, they just know.
But this sounded wrong to me, so I asked the next logical one: Did your parents come to school for programming teacher to teach them computers so they can teach you? At this point he looked at me "over the tip of his nose", (it is amazing how many details I remember from those couple of hours) and said: We have a computer at home! WAAAAAAAAT? A Computer AT HOME, that is cheating, that is .... argh.
So I gave up on him as a total scumbag and went to ask another classmate about how he learned computers.
Pretty soon I found out that one had a computer at home too. After that I simply went to everybody and asked: Do you have a computer at home? of 25 kids, there were only 3 (me included) who did not.
I was too young at that point to realize the full concept of "elite school" and all socio-economic implications, but I did realize one thing:
I am not stupid, all those offsprings of female dogs where cheating!
At this moment I looked at the sky and said:
"Crom, I have never prayed to you before. I have no tongue for it. No one, not even you will remember if we were smart kids or stupid kids, why we fought, or why we died. No, all that matters is that I am really really pissed off now, that's what's important. Valor pleases you, Crom, so grant me one request, grant me revenge! And if you do not listen, then to hell with you!"

After school, with a clear head, and berserker rage still in my heart, I went to my father, looked him straight in the eye and said: "I want a computer".

It is a testament to my rage that I did this, for my father was NOT a kind of man you made demands of.
There were no child protection laws in those days and my father was a violent man.
I was frequently beaten as a kid for no reason at all, or for minor reasons like breaking neighbours windows, missing from home for three days or believing that multiple mercedes-benz signs would look really cool on my string necklace ( they did )

Anyways my father being a mighty warrior himself (there is a whole book in there), recognized the Cimmerian in my gaze, looked at me in silence for 5 minutes to see if I break and finally asked: Do other kids have computers? YES. How many other kids? EVERYBODY.
Then he said the customary: If you are lying to me... (without the need to finish the sentence ofc) and went off and bought me the most expencive computer he could.
It cost 2200 Deutsche Marks, an unbelievable sum in those times.
And he said unto me: My son I have forged this mighty weapon for thee, practice well and become the mightiest of computer warriors or I will whip thy arse until there is no more skin on it.
The rest as they say is history.

Except of course that I forgot to mention the EL-9400, a terminator sent from the future to make me a programmer when I was 14, one year before above events took place, but that is another story.
